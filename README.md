This google doc will no longer be updated. Instead, see what tasks have been assigned to you above and
implement them by making a feature branch _on this repo_.

If you're stuck or unsure what to do, please reach out to me! Also, read through the comments in the 
view model to get an idea of how to approach the function assigned to you.
